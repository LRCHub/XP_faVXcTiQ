What goes around comes back around.
What goes around comes back around.
“Sit down and listen.”
Back in business to even up the score;
We lost the battle, but now we win the war.
Ah~
This world of dull routines,
Living in monotony.
Can’t escape it?
Watch us, we’ll break it.
The old rules do not apply (apply)
You better kiss them all goodbye (goodbye)
It’s our turn, so stand aside,
Ain’t nothing gonna stem this rising tide.
We’re through with convention and being
controlled,
We dish out revenge and we’re serving it cold.
Yeah, yeah.
Don’t you know what we been told?
That “what goes around will come back around,”
They tried to bury us, but we never stay down.
No more playing nice,
Now it’s just an eye for an eye; two wrongs are
making it right.
We broke our chains, and now, the world above is
gonna come down.
So come and get it,
We’re coming around,
We’re taking you down.
We’re coming around,
We’re taking you down.
Shattered glass and tattered walls,
We’re coming fast, gonna break it all.
Do you hear the sirens cry?
What a perfect lullaby,
'Cause we’re taking over tonight.
Yeah.
Hey, hey!
Wake up! (Wake up!) Them’s the breaks.
You gotta reap what you sow, so it’s time to
pay.
All your games are uninspired,
We’re here to light up a fire.
No more mandates, we can set the world ablaze.
Yeah, yeah.
Don’t you know what people say?
That “what goes around will come back around,”
They tried to bury us, but we never stay down.
No more playing nice,
Now it’s just an eye for an eye; two wrongs are
making it right.
We broke our chains, and now, the world above is
gonna come down so loud,
What goes around is coming back ‘round and ‘
round,
The world is never living this down,
So come and get it,
We’re coming around,
We’re taking you down.
We’re coming around,
We’re taking you down.
[Oh, that’s what comes around…]
We won’t run, and we won’t stop.
We’re still not done coming out on top
[What comes around]
No more silence, no more fear,
Now the world will know we’re here,
We’ll make it abundantly clear:
What goes around comes back around,
What goes around comes back around.
